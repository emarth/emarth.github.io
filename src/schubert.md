Welcome! There will be many useful things posted here eventually. For now:

- [*3264 and All That: Intersection Theory in Algebraic Geometry*](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37367570) by Eisenbud and Harris
- Some other useful books:
    - Harris *Algebraic Geometry: A First Course* 
    - Hartshorne *Algebraic Geometry* 
    - Eisenbud *Commutative Algebra with a View Towards Algebraic Geometry*
    - Fulton *Intersection Theory*
- A [review of *Intersection Theory*](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-12/issue-1/Review--William-Fulton-Intersection-theory-and-William-Fulton-Introduction/bams/1183552346.full) by Kleiman which gives a short history of the subject
